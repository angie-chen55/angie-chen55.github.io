Hi! I'm a PhD student at NYU Center for Data Science in the [Machine Learning for Language](https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/) group, advised by [Sam Bowman](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/) and [Kyunghyun Cho](https://kyunghyuncho.me/). I'm broadly interested in deep learning for natural language understanding, code generation, model robustness, and improved evaluation metrics for NLU models. I have also previously worked as a student researcher at Google Research (Jun-Dec. 2021) on streaming models for disfluency detection and at Google Brain (Jun. 2022-Mar. 2023) on LMs for neural architecture search (NAS).

Prior to NYU, I worked as a software engineer at Google and graduated with high honors from Princeton Computer Science. [Sebastian Seung](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/people/profile/sseung) advised my senior thesis at Princeton, for which I received an Outstanding Computer Science Thesis award.

Outside of my research, I enjoy running, baking more pastries than I can feasibly eat, and cooking. I also volunteer as a rape and domestic violence crisis counselor/victim advocate for the [NYC Crime Victims Treatment Center](https://www.cvtcnyc.org/) (at Lenox Health Greenwich Village and Brookdale Hospital) and a crisis counselor for [Crisis Text Line](https://www.crisistextline.org/).
